          <h2>Welcome !</h2>
          <p>

            Since I have to introduce myself and in case you didn't guess or noticed, I am Franco Randriamasy (Yes, like the old spain dictator,nice to you too! and thank your for you support, never easy right ?), the web developper which created this web page (you don't say?!). As most of us in life, we choose a path which lead us in the "I don't have a fucking idea, what am I doing and where" part of the life. For me, I went for science field and got my Bachelor's degree in Chemistry in 2019. Long story short, 
            I end-up in the Financal IT industry the very same year as I graduated.
            And now as part of content creator myself, I feel the need to give you some feel good and inspirational part of this introduction: 
            I was born in really poor country called Madagascar, move out to Europe and made my way until now.
            I've got influenced not thanks to Youtube or tick tock (this kind of influencer, those are trash mostly) but by the poeple I have met in life.
            I've met good and bad people (I don't know in which proportion, this why sometimes I want Thanos to shortly visit planet earth and wipe out half of the population but as I don't know the real ratio of good people in this earth maybe is a bad idea to judge things only by your own preception) but I tend to look-up on good poeple and inspire myself to do good things the best I can.
            So now, you might wonder "hm ok, nice but what's the point with this website ? " and to answer you, Nothing! But here I can share with you some of my personal intrest and improvement in the technology field, but wait, 
            there's more.

              At work I am using mostly a really ancient technology called cobol which nowaday pretty much nobody is aware of its mere existence. But this 60 years old
              technology is still worth to learn as most of the old solid Financial, Governement, University institutions are still using it. if you want to work in a niche field but still earn decent
              amount of ducks(ho! sorry I mean "bucks") then, perharps you should consider it. 
              In order to manage clients data, sql is the goat (alongside of course any other query languages, so no fight here guys! ). But hey! this is first the back-end  technology where I started from. Better start somewhere right ?
              Now the more exiting part for me, but also the most mainstream one, the front-end technologies I am working on are : html5, CSS and Java-script. This website is currently using only HTML5 and CSS but is aleardy sexy don't you agree ?

            <p>
              Currently, my soft skill is a little bit poor, I use github as versioning tool and a way to nest my website. Visual studio code is where I obviously code this website.
              At work I use Amazon Web Service, this is where all the business magic is happening. If you want to create your business and want it to be at the top technology and scalable,
              you should really take it seriously. Because the brand with a little smirk in the face, is growing. And for those who is not really in touch with the IT industry, we can resume the situation like this:
              Amazon = Internet. Nothing more, nothing less. They provide most of the web services to the IT industry, all the applications running currently are probably running in the Amazon Web Service Server. 
              We are not done, I am not done, this the beginning there is more in comming and like Ash-Ketchum in pokemon, I want to catch them all and be the very best, I can. 
              Because in life you are competiting only against two things: First yourself and second as a biological being, time itself.

          <h2>Let's get intemate a little bit</h2>
          <h3>At the end of the day, you may wonder "what's the point of this website ?" </h3>
          <p>
            So This website, is about experiences. And by experience, you have to understand it in the largest way of your abilities. This is my first website. And for those of you who don't know me, I was a former scientist, 
            who worked most of a the time in a chemistry lab and have experienced the world of research. My former self was a really analytical person and it has its perk but I knew deep inside me that I am more than that. I begin to find out that I love creating but also using my old
            brain a little bit.

            So you get it, I like to descover thing, learn new trick and keep going. As I grow older, I discover something, people don't realise that time is their ennemy. Don't get me wrong, you can't do shit againt the entropy. Time goes in one direction and won't comeback. And god knows how much time I have waisted.
            Playing video games, thinking about loves instead of living it, my  gosh  man if I could go back in time, I would probably punch myself so hard that my spirit would have met it creator.  
          </p>
          <p>
            So, by time waiting, I decided to stop and think a little bit. I noticed, that some poeple make their choice and I suspect that they are not really aware of their state. When I question some poeple about the path they
            have choosen in life and try to see if they still desire to improve or do something else. Usually, the same excuses are given: "I am too old","I don't have time","I am too dumb"... And excuses, you can alway find one, 
            As for me when my diet is not going well, my excuses is the tell myself "ho man you, you've done so much since the beginning and you can reward youself by doing a cheat-meal" and you know that you are going to go from a cheat-meal to another cheat-meal, until this cheat-meal is your new diet.
          </p>
          <p>
            And poeple is usually like that, there are many excuses that can be told to explain your lack of motivation to improve. Even their hourse, car and even their own kids as an excuse to stagnate in a job they don't like."You know my I have bills to pay, and my job is providing me security", but they the thing they don't 
            realise is job security is a myth. There is only Skill security. And through technology, this is even more true. Tech world, is a fast pace environment where you will always have to keep up to the trend. It doesn't always fit to everylife still because you will always end-up in a constant learning curve. And as person who falls easily bored in life, it's fit perfectly mine.
          </p>
          <p>
            To finish, I want poeple to question they life and try to think seriously "am I happy" ? If you are happy then you did everything fine until this very moment, if not, question yourself about what can you do to be happy. Is it a job goal ? a new partner in life, a nice house, a nice car, travel more ? probably a little bit of all that.
            Then I am sorry my freind but you will have to hustle harder then. If you want to achieve your goal one day or to be close enough. Because at the end of the day, you know that it was not the goal that was important, but one day, when you will get old, you can look years back and tell  yourself, I did my best effort to achieve something and I have no regret.
            This is what is website is about. Past and future experience.
